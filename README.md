# Planet Kubb

This is the code for the [Planet Kubb](http://planetkubb.com) website. You can contribute to the code base and improve the user experience on Planet Kubb by modifying this repository.

## How to Use This

Planet Kubb is generated using [Rawdog](http://offog.org/code/rawdog.html). Rawdog is a Python application that you can easily build in most systems, and is also available as a package for many Linux distributions. Once you have Rawdog installed, you can run `update.sh` in the root of this repository and it will build the site. Rerun to regenerate the files.

## Frameworks

Planet Kubb uses the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) CSS/HTML syntax so feel free to add anything that leverages that. Additionally [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is already in.
